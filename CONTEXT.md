# ðŸ§­ Project Context

## Vision
Create an agentic AI system that fully automates infrastructure management with human-like reasoning capabilities.

## Core Principles
1. **Autonomy First** - Maximize autonomous operation
2. **Security by Design** - Never compromise on security
3. **Transparency** - All decisions must be explainable
4. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities
5. **Reliability** - Production-grade stability

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
- Must maintain audit trails of all actions
- No hardcoded credentials
- All infrastructure changes must be traceable to a decision
- Must support multi-cloud environments
- Must be developer-friendly

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Agent-Based Architecture** - Multiple specialized agents working together
2. **Immutable Infrastructure** - All changes through code
3. **Declarative Configuration** - Define desired state, not procedures
4. **Observability First** - Comprehensive logging and metrics

## Project Boundaries
### In Scope
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Configuration management
- Security and compliance
- Cost optimization

### Out of Scope
