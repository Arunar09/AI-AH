   - Prevention: Remote state with locking, CI/CD coordination

2. **Resource already exists error**
   - Diagnosis: Resource exists in AWS but not in Terraform state
   - Solutions: Import resource, check AWS console, use data sources
   - Prevention: Always use terraform plan, keep state in sync

3. **Permission denied errors**
   - Diagnosis: Insufficient IAM permissions
   - Solutions: Check IAM policies, verify credentials, review CloudTrail
   - Prevention: Least privilege policies, IAM roles, regular audits
