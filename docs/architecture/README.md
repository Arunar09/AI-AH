## Architecture Overview

The AI-AH platform is built with a modular, agent-based architecture:

- **Core Framework**: Base platform and agent framework
- **Agents**: Specialized agents for different infrastructure tasks
- **API Layer**: RESTful API and WebSocket communication
- **Tools**: Integration with external tools and services
- **UI**: Web and CLI interfaces

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component is independently deployable
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities
3. **Security**: Built-in security and compliance features
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agents and capabilities
